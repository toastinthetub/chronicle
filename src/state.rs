// TODO: implement state lols!
// TODO: implement UI mainloop
//      - should exist in state.rs or in terminal.rs? i am thinking
//        state.rs? and terminal.rs gets to hold all of our little
//        functions for manipulating shit! but must be careful not to
//        abstract too close to the sun...perhaps write a small TUI
//        library that sits on top of Crossterm for UI. Yes. I like.
